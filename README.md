# Athletes Project

## [See the App!](https://rennect.cyclic.app/)

## Description

- "Runnect" is a combination of the words "run" and "connect." It suggests the idea of connecting or networking with other runners or running enthusiasts through the platform. It conveys the concept of bringing together individuals who share a passion for running, creating a sense of community and connection within the running world.

**NOTE -** My project is a marathon event finder that allows users to locate nearby races and explore profiles of participating athletes.

## User Stories

**NOTE -** This is the list of action that you can do in the app. Example:

- **404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault
- **500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
- **homepage** - As a user, i am able to access the homepage so that you can see what the app is about and login and signup.
- **sign up** - As a user, i can sign up on the webpage so that you can see all the events that you could attend.
